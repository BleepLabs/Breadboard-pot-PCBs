Breadboard mount pots that don't require jumper wires to connect them to the power bus lines. This makes it quick and easy to use them with ADCs and allows more pots to fit on a breadboard than my [previous version](https://bleeplabs.com/product/the-rad-fi-system/).

Purple is the top layer, teal is the bottom.  
I realized the top corner pins would touch the body of the pot and might connect the bus lines as the solder pads for the pot body are pretty much touching the other bus lines. I removed the pin in those locations but kept the plastic body of the pin header to increase stability.  
The bottom corner pins are unconnected.   
  
I'll be selling these at some point. Sign up for the Bleep Labs mailing list to be notified about all future products and workshops.
